No matter how fast or slow your backend or datasources\n- **Fault tolerance**. By default, backend errors don't invalidate the pre-generated copy\n- **Realtime updates**. Updates can be triggered as frequently as every second. Say goodbye to slow page rebuilds!\n- **Cost effectiveness**. We only issue one request to your backend functions, while serving it **millions of times a second**.\n- **Great for SEO**. Solutions involving client-heavy stacks delay Google's crawling by up to two weeks. Serverless pre-rendering fixes that.",

With multiple users editing stories in realtime and breaking news.\n- **High-traffic APIs**. Where computation is debounced in order to minimize load.\n- **Mission-critical dashboards**. Where lots of dynamic is consumed by many users.",
